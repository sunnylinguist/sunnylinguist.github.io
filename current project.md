      My current and future research follows a staged trajectory that investigates how pronunciation is socially perceived within bilingual contexts, how these perceptions evolve across different bilingual populations, how exposure and treatment influence perception and phonetic production, and how AI-driven feedback may reinforce or challenge pronunciation ideologies, particularly <strong>native-speakerism</strong>.

     <div class="stage-card">
  <strong>Stage1: Pronunciation ideologies in the Korean EFL bilingual context</strong><br>
  • Examines how Korean EFL learners, positioned as bilinguals, perceive pronunciation and accentedness within foreign language education.<br>
  • Investigates how pronunciation ideologies shape identity negotiation and perceived legitimacy.

<div class="stage-card">
  <strong>Stage2: Heritage bilingual perspectives</strong><br>
  • Focuses on how heritage speakers of Korean experience accentedness across their heritage and societal languages.<br>
  • Investigates how ideological forces influence their linguistic authority and sense of belonging.
</div>

  <div class="stage-card">
  <strong>Stage3: Exposure-based phonetic and applied experimentation</strong><br>
  • Investigates how exposure to different accented varieties in both English and Korean influences bilingual learners’ perception and production over time.<br>
  • Integrates phonetic (theoretical) and applied experimental methods to analyze changes in accentedness, comprehensibility, and intelligibility.

<div class="stage-card">
  <strong>Stage 4: AI interaction, feedback, and ideology</strong><br>
  • Examines how interaction with AI feedback systems using different accent varieties influences bilingual learners’ perception, production, and attitudes toward accentedness.<br>
  • Investigates whether AI-mediated environments reinforce or challenge pronunciation ideologies such as native-speakerism, based on the type of feedback and accent exposure.
