# Hello! 
My name is **Sunwoo (Sunny) Lee** and I'm a 3rd year Ph.D. student in the Linguistics department at Georgetown University. 
My research interests are mainly based on socially contextualized tension between accentedness and comprehensibility and/or intelligibility of second language speakers and heritage speakers.  
This website introduces my current and past research projects and I'm happy to get in touch with you!
