# Hello! ðŸ‘‹  
My name is **Sunwoo (Sunny) Lee**, and I'm a 3rd year Ph.D. student in the Linguistics department at Georgetown University.

<br>

My research interests focus on socially contextualized tensions between **accentedness**, **comprehensibility**, and **intelligibility** in second language and heritage speaker populations.  
This website introduces my current and past research projects, and Iâ€™m happy to get in touch with you!
