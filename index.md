    <h1>Hello! 👋</h1>
    <p>
      My name is <strong>Sunwoo (Sunny) Lee</strong>, and I'm a 3rd year Ph.D. student in the Linguistics Department at Georgetown University.
      My research interests focus on socially contextualized tensions between <strong>accentedness</strong>, 
      <strong>comprehensibility</strong>, and <strong>intelligibility</strong> in second language and heritage speaker populations.
    </p>
    <p>
      This website introduces my current and past research projects, and I’m happy to connect with scholars, educators, and learners who share similar interests.
