   My name is <strong>Sunwoo (Sunny) Lee</strong>, and I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Linguistics at Georgetown University with a strong dual background in <strong>theoretical phonetics/phonology and applied linguistics</strong>. 
      <p>
    My research centers on <strong>bilingual speech</strong> and the socially constructed tensions between <strong>accentedness</strong>, <strong>comprehensibility</strong>, and <strong>intelligibility</strong>, grounded in ideologies such as <em>native-speakerism</em>. 
      </p>

My current research agenda, 
<strong>“Socially Contextualized Accentedness in Bilingual Speech”</strong>, is structured around: <br>
(1) the social and ideological implications of accentedness in bilingual communities, <br>
(2) its extension into the AI era, where pronunciation technologies may reproduce or challenge existing linguistic hierarchies.
