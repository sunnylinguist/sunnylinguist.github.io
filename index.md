   Hello! My name is <strong>Sunwoo (Sunny) Lee</strong>, and I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Linguistics Department at Georgetown University with a strong dual background in <strong>theoretical phonetics/phonology </strong> and <strong> applied linguistics.</strong> 
      <p>
    My research centers on bilingual speech and the socially constructed tensions between accentedness, comprehensibility, and intelligibility, grounded in ideologies such as native-speakerism. 
      </p>

My current research agenda, 
<strong>“Socially Contextualized Accentedness in Bilingual Speech”</strong>, is structured around: <br>
(1) the social and ideological implications of accentedness in bilingual communities, <br>
(2) its extension into the AI era, where pronunciation technologies may reproduce or challenge existing linguistic hierarchies. <br>
Details on ongoing and future projects can be found in the 
<a href="/current-project/"><em>Current project</em></a>!
