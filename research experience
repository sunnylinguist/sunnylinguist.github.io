    <h2>Past Work &amp; Motivation</h2>

     My work began in <strong>experimental phonetics</strong> within <strong>bilingualism</strong>, asking how bilinguals
navigate different phonetic systems across language backgrounds, heritage status, and task demands.
These studies led me to broader questions about <strong>accentedness, comprehensibility, and intelligibility</strong> among <strong>bilingual speakers</strong>
and how <strong>social contexts</strong> shape pronunciation in both <em>perception</em> and <em>production</em>.
The sections below provide a detailed overview of my current and future research directions!
