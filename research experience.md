  <h3>Past Work &amp; Motivation</h3>
  <p>
    My work began in <strong>experimental phonetics</strong> within <strong>bilingualism</strong>, asking how bilinguals
    navigate different phonetic systems across language backgrounds, heritage status, and task demands.
    These studies led me to broader questions about <strong>accentedness, comprehensibility, and intelligibility</strong> among <strong>bilingual speakers</strong>
    and how <strong>social contexts</strong> shape pronunciation in both <em>perception</em> and <em>production</em>.

  <h3>Evolution of Research Focus</h3>
  <p>
    While my early work focused on empirical phonetic patterns, my research trajectory shifted as I experienced linguistic diversity firsthand after moving from Korea to the United States. 
    Growing up in an English-as-a-foreign-language context, pronunciation was primarily framed as achieving proximity to a single “standard.” 
    However, living in a multilingual environment revealed that what is perceived as a “good” or “acceptable” accent is deeply shaped by social ideologies rather than purely linguistic criteria.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through both research and personal experience, I became aware of the tension between being fully <strong>comprehensible</strong> yet still considered <strong>accented</strong>, which often implies a lack of legitimacy or belonging. 
    This awareness led me to reframe pronunciation not simply as a phonetic outcome, but as a socially situated act that reflects identity, access, and power.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, recognizing that studying abroad and immersive learning represent privileged experiences available only to a subset of learners, I grew interested in how <strong>AI-driven pronunciation tools</strong> are increasingly positioned as accessible alternatives. 
    My current research explores how these technologies may reproduce ideologies of native-speakerism, whose accent is legitimized, and how we might reimagine pronunciation training through the lens of <em>linguistic justice</em> and global diversity.
