    <h2>Past Work &amp; Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      My work began in <strong>experimental phonetics</strong> within <strong>bilingualism</strong>, asking how bilinguals
      navigate different phonetic systems across language backgrounds, heritage status, and task demands.
      These studies led me to broader questions about <strong>accentedness, comprehensibility, and intelligibility</strong>
      and how social context shapes pronunciation in both <em>perception</em> and <em>production</em>.

    <h2>Current Directions</h2>
    <p>
      Building on prior findings and my experience as an international student from South Korea, my current work centers on
      <strong>societal and ideological dimensions</strong> of pronunciation, including “correctness” ideologies, listener bias,
      and the impact of rapidly growing <strong>AI speaking apps</strong> in Korea on <em>native-speakerism</em>.
