My work began in **experimental phonetics** within **bilingualism**, asking how bilinguals navigate different phonetic systems across language backgrounds, heritage status, and task demands.

## Selected Presentations
- **PSLLT 2025, Montreal** – Poster/Talk on bilingual phonetic variability
- **NWAV-AP 8, Singapore** – Sociophonetic patterns in bilingual/heritage speech

## Current Research Interests
Drawing on my prior observations on **accents**—and my experiences as an international student from South Korea in North American contexts—my current projects take a more **societal and ideological** perspective:
- How pronunciation ideologies shape **perception** and **production** for both speakers and listeners
- The prevalence of “**correct** pronunciation” discourses in South Korea and their social consequences
- The rise of **AI speaking apps** in Korea and whether they reinforce pronunciation ideologies through **native-speakerism**
- Implications for **accentedness, comprehensibility, and intelligibility** among L2 and heritage speakers

## Ongoing & Planned Projects
- **Work 1** — *Title TBD*  
  Brief description of aims, data, and expected contributions (e.g., perception experiment with bilingual listeners).
- **Work 2** — *Title TBD*  
  Short summary (e.g., production study examining task effects on segmental vs. suprasegmental cues).
- **Work 3** — *Title TBD*  
  Short summary (e.g., audit study on listener bias toward “correctness” in Korean English).
- **Work 4** — *Title TBD*  
  Short summary (e.g., critical evaluation of AI speaking apps and native-speakerism).
