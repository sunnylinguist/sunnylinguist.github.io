My work began in **experimental phonetics** within **bilingualism**, asking how bilinguals navigate different phonetic systems across language backgrounds, heritage status, and task demands.

## Selected Presentation
**PSLLT 2025 (Montreal)** – Research on bilingual phonetic variability and language backgrounds
**NWAV-AP 8 (Singapore)** – Sociophonetic patterns in bilingual and heritage speakers

## Current Research Interests
Grounded in my previous findings on **accentedness** and my own lived experiences as an international student from South Korea, my current research focuses on the **societal and ideological dimensions** of pronunciation. Specifically, I examine:

How ideologies of “**correct**” pronunciation influence both **perception** and **production**
How such ideologies differ across contexts (L2, heritage, study abroad)
The growing prevalence of **AI speaking applications** in South Korea
Whether these technologies reinforce **native-speakerism** or promote **comprehensibility-oriented perspectives**

## Ongoing & Planned Projects

**Work 3** — *Description coming soon*
