    <h2>Past Work &amp; Motivation</h2>
    <p>
     My work began in <strong>experimental phonetics</strong> within <strong>bilingualism</strong>, asking how bilinguals
navigate different phonetic systems across language backgrounds, heritage status, and task demands.
These studies led me to broader questions about <strong>accentedness, comprehensibility, and intelligibility</strong> among <strong>bilingual speakers</strong>
and how <strong>social contexts</strong> shape pronunciation in both <em>perception</em> and <em>production</em>.
The sections below provide a detailed overview of my current and future research directions!

    <h2>Current Directions</h2>
    <p>
      My current and future research follows a staged trajectory that examines how pronunciation is <strong>socially</strong> perceived for <strong>bilingual speakers</strong>, how such perceptions evolve across different speaker populations, how exposure and treatment can shape listeners’ perception and speakers’ phonetic production, and how emerging AI-driven feedback technologies may reinforce or challenge existing pronunciation ideologies, namely the ideology of <strong>native-speakerism</strong>.
    </p>

     <div class="stage-card">
  <strong>Stage 1 — Investigating pronunciation ideologies in the Korean EFL context as a bilingual trajectory</strong><br>
  • This stage examines how Korean learners, positioned as emerging bilinguals, experience pronunciation ideologies in foreign language education.<br>
  • I focus on constructs such as learners’ perceived legitimacy, pronunciation-related anxiety, and identity negotiation as they navigate their bilingual trajectories.<br>
  • Additionally, I investigate how attitudes toward one’s own L1 (including regional dialects) inform ideologies surrounding L2 pronunciation.<br>
  • Methodologically, this stage employs semi-structured interviews in combination with questionnaire data.
</div>

    <div class="stage-card">
  <strong>Stage 2 — Expanding to transnational bilingual and heritage speaker contexts</strong><br>
  • This stage extends the inquiry from emerging bilinguals in the Korean EFL context to transnational bilinguals, particularly heritage speakers of Korean, who actively navigate two linguistic systems and cultural identities.<br>
  • I investigate how pronunciation ideologies influence speakers’ linguistic development and identity positioning across both their heritage language and the dominant societal language, with <strong>accentedness</strong> serving as a key construct in shaping perceived legitimacy and belonging.<br>
  • This stage further incorporates a comparative perspective by examining how national language policies and sociopolitical contexts in Korea and abroad shape bilingual speakers’ pronunciation ideologies.<br>
  • Methodologically, this stage follows a similar qualitative approach to Stage 1, drawing on semi-structured interviews and questionnaire-based perception measures.

    <div class="stage-card">
  <strong>Stage 3 — Experimental treatments and phonetic analysis of perception and production</strong><br>
  • This stage investigates how exposure to different varieties of accented speech—across both English and Korean—shapes learners’ trajectories as bilingual speakers.<br>
  • I employ a pre–during–post design to examine changes in both <em>perception</em> and <em>production</em>, assessing whether (and how) learners' attitudes, processing patterns, and pronunciation outcomes shift over time.<br>
  • For production, I incorporate experimental phonetic methods to analyze salient acoustic features from both top-down (ideology-driven) and bottom-up (acoustic-salience-driven) perspectives, with accentedness treated as a measurable construct.<br>
  • This stage aims to reveal the extent to which exposure-based treatments can promote phonetic flexibility, influence comprehensibility and intelligibility, or reinforce existing pronunciation ideologies.
</div>

<div class="stage-card">
  <strong>Stage 4 — AI-mediated interaction and feedback</strong><br>
  • This stage investigates how interaction with AI speech feedback systems shapes learners’ pronunciation development and ideological stances toward accentedness.<br>
  • I compare conditions in which learners interact with AI models using familiar (common or prestige) accents versus less familiar varieties to determine whether such environments reinforce or challenge existing pronunciation ideologies.<br>
  • A key focus is to examine not only positive outcomes—such as increased awareness or improvement—but also the potential emergence of negative perceptions, resistance, or reinforced native-speakerism, which remains underexplored in current AI pronunciation research.<br>
  • Methodologically, this stage may utilize existing AI platforms or involve collaboration to develop a custom interface, allowing for controlled manipulation of accent types and feedback modalities (visual, auditory, automated scoring).
